Ques 1: Count Digits in a number 
Example => Input N=12345;
           Output = 5;

Ques 2: Reverse a number 
Example => n=123;
           output = 321;

Ques 3: Check if palindrome or not 
=> a number is said to be palindrome when it is read as same from backward as well as forward.
Example : 121 

Ques 4: Check armstrong or not 
Example => n = 153 
           then, 1^3+5^3+3^3 if this equals to 153 then it is a armstrong 

           n = 1742 
           then, 1^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 + 2^4 if this equals to 1742 then its is armstrong otherwise it is not 

Ques 5: Print all the divisior
Example => n=36 
           Output = 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 16 36 
           Explanation => print all the number that divide n completly without any reminder till n; 
        
Ques 6: Prime or not 
=> a prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by 1 and by itself.
           example => like number 3 is a prime number, 7 is a prime number as they are only divisible by 1 and by itself.

Ques 7: Find GCD of two numbers
Example => Input: num1 = 4, num2 = 8
           Output: 4
           Explanation: Since 4 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.
